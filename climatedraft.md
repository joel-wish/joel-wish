The best antidote to climate defeatism is action â€“ not just from scientists and governments, we need top talent from every industry focused on scaling
climate solutions. 

Climate Draft is building an on-ramp for that talent. We offer programming, educational resources, and curated networking to connect experienced operators
from other fields to with climate tech startups that can benefit from their skills and experience.

Our inaugural cohort in October 2021 resulted in 429 double opt-in intros between 80 leading executives (including current and former C-level 
at public companies) and 68 climate tech startups.
